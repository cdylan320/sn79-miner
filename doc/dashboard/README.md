## Validator Page
The main page at which visitors to the dashboard land is the Validators page.  This page displays overview data for the simulation hosted by each sn79 validator.

### Validator Info
![alt text](validator_info.png)

The top part of the dashboard page displays basic details of the selected validator.

The first row just indicates the UID, hotkey address and current simulation time.

The second row contains metagraph data for the validator - stake, vTrust, last update, emission and dividends.  See the [bittensor documentation](https://docs.learnbittensor.org/subnets/metagraph) for details on the meaning of these variables.

The third row displays the current resource usage of the validator hosting instance.

### Simulation Config
![alt text](validator_config.png)

The next section displays the most central simulation config parameters.

- **Books** - Number of order books in the simulation.

- **Duration** - Total simulation runtime in simulation time.

- **Time Unit** - Smallest time increment in the simulation.

- **Init Period** - Initial warm-up/stabilization period before miner agents are able to participate.

- **Init Agents** - Number of initialization agents present in the simulation.

- **Init Wealth** - Initial wealth allocated to each initialization agent.

- **HFT Agents** - Number of high-frequency trading agents.

- **HFT Wealth** - Total initial capital allocated to each HFT agent.

### Fee Policy
![alt text](validator_fee_policy.png)

The next section displays configuration parameters for the fees applied in the simulation, as well as a visualization of the central parameter determining the fees in the [Dynamic Incentive Structure (DIS)](https://simulate.trading/taos-im-dis-paper) fee mechanism.

#### Fee Parameters

- **Policy** - Fee structure model being applied (e.g., DIS - Dynamic Incentive Structure).

- **Target MTR** - Target maker-to-taker ratio, the desired proportion of maker trades to taker trades executed by miner agents.

- **Trade Window** - Time window (in seconds or time units) used for calculating MTR.

- **Base Maker Rate** - Baseline fee rate charged on maker trades.

- **Base Taker Rate** - Baseline fee rate charged on taker trades.

- **Max Rebate** - Maximum rebate percentage.

- **Max Fee** - Maximum fee percentage.

- **Fee Shape** - Parameter controlling the evolution of fee values.

- **Rebate Shape** - Parameter controlling the evolution of rebate values.

#### Maker-Taker Ratio Chart 

This provides a visual representation of the maker-to-taker ratio over time across all the simulated books.  The fees applicable to trades are dependent on the MTR: divergences from the target towards higher maker ratio incur fees on makers during trades while takers receive a rebate, and if there is a higher proportion of trades where miner agents are the taker then makers will receive rebate while takers pay a fee.

### Trade Data

## Agent Page

This page displays detailed statistics for a particular agent over all books for either a specific validator or all validators in the subnet. It is most easily accessed by clicking the links in either the Trades or Agents table at the Validators page.

### Agent Info

![alt text](agent_data.png)

The first two rows display basic information about the selected agent.

The unique identifier for the agent and the current simulation time are presented in the first row.

The second row shows the key metagraph statistics for the agent - consensus, emission, incentive and trust.

### Score Plot

![alt text](agent_score.png)

The topmost left plot displays the total score for the agent as assigned by the selected validator(s) on the right y-axis, and the incentive of the agent on the left y-axis.

### Performance Plot

![alt text](agent_performance.png)

The Performance plot illustrates the ranking in terms of score of the agent over time as assigned by the selected validator(s), as well as an average ranking taken over all selected validators.  The ranking indicates where among the subnet miners this agent places; higher ranking indicates outperformance of others.

### Trades Table

![alt text](agent_trades.png)

The Trades table shows details of the latest 5 trades on each book for the select agent:

- **Validator** - Hotkey of the validator in whose simulation the trade took place.

### Requests Plot

![alt text](agent_requests.png)

This plot illustrates statistics related to communication with validators; the left hand y-axis shows the average response time of the miner via the dotted blue line, while the right y-axis indicates counts of requests completed with different status:

- **Requests** - Total count of requests received in the observation window.
- **Success** - Responses successfully received by validators from the selected miner.
- **Failures** - Responses which failed to be received by the validator due to reasons other than timeout (e.g. network configuration issue).
- **Timeouts** - Responses not received by the validator due to exceeding the response timeout.
- **Rejections** - Responses not sent to validator due to blacklisting rules.

### Daily Volume Plot

![alt text](agent_volume.png)

This plot illustrates the average volumes over all selected validators which were traded by the selected agent over the last 24 simulation hours.  Volumes which the agent had traded in maker and taker role are illustrated as well as the total volume.  The agent's activity factor on average and for each book is also plotted; this is a function of the total traded volume and was applied to the unrealized Sharpe in obtaining the final unrealized score.  Although after release of version 0.2.0 the unrealized Sharpe is no longer used in obtaining miner scores, the total trading volume is important to monitor due to the trading volume cap indicated by the dashed red line - agents will be restricted from placing any new orders on books where the total trading volume exceeds this threshold.

### Round-Trip Volume Plot

![alt text](agent_roundtrip_volume.png)

This plot illustrates the average volumes over all selected validators which were round-tripped (either bought then sold or sold and then bought to open and close a position and thus realized a profit or loss) by the selected agent over the last 24 simulation hours.  The realized activity factor which is multiplied onto the realized Sharpe in obtaining the final realized Sharpe score for the agent is also plotted on average and for each book.

### Realized PnL Plot

![alt text](agent_realized_pnl.png)

This plot illustrates the realized PnL achieved by the agent in the most recent Sharpe assessment window over time.  Realized PnL is calculated from round tripped trades, using the price difference and fees/rebates to calculate the profit or loss realized through trading activity.

### Realized Sharpe Plots

![alt text](agent_realized_sharpe.png)

The Realized Sharpe plot displays the raw (unnormalized and unweighted) realized Sharpe ratio achieved by the agent on all books, as well as the median value.
The Realized Sharpe Score plot displays the normalized and weighted Sharpe Score calculated for the agent for each book, as well as the median value.  The outlier penalty applied to the score is also plotted.

### Unrealized Profit & Loss Plots

![alt text](agent_pnl.png)

The Total Inventory Value Change plot illustrates the unrealized PnL (change in total inventory value) achieved by the agent since start of simulation or registration, for each book as well as in total.
The Unrealized PnL plot ilustrates the profit and loss (change in inventory value) achieved by the agent over the preceding Sharpe assessment window, for each book individually and in total.

### Unrealized Sharpe Plots

![alt text](agent_sharpe.png)

The Sharpe plot displays the raw (unnormalized and unweighted) Sharpe ratio achieved by the agent on all books, as well as the median value.
The Sharpe Score plot displays the normalized and weighted Sharpe Score calculated for the agent for each book as well as the median value.  The outlier penalty applied to the score is also plotted.
Since version 0.2.0, only realized Sharpe contributes to agent scoring - these plots are retained for reference only.

### Fee Rates Plot

![alt text](agent_fees.png)

This plot displays a history of the fee rates paid by the agent in trades, for each book and on average.  The average and per-book MTR is also plotted.

### Balances Plots

![alt text](agent_balances.png)

The BASE and QUOTE balances and loans for the agent are plotted for each book as well as in total over all books.
